This project is intended to be an interactive webapp that is a feature matrix for GitHub Copilot's features. The intent is to allow the user to view the current feature matrix for the latest version of all IDEs, view a breakdown of the version each IDE had a certain feature released or view a breakdown of the features available for a specific IDE/version 

This project is intended to let users "slice and dice" "IDE versions x feature support" as they'd like, from any angle. this means, if they want to choose an ide and a version and just see the feature matrix of what's supported on that version, they can! If instead, they'd rather choose a feature and see a list of all IDEs and corresponding versions that started supporting that feature, they can!


### OLD / UNUSED INFO
