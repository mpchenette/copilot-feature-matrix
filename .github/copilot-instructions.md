This project is intended to be an interactive webapp that is a feature matrix for GitHub Copilot's features. The intent is to allow the user to filter by IDE, by IDE version, by Copilot extension version or by feature.

This project is intended to let users "slice and dice" "IDE versions x feature support" as they'd like, from any angle. this means, if they want to choose an ide and a version and just see the feature matrix of what's supported on that version, they can! If instead, they'd rather choose a feature and see a list of all IDEs and corresponding versions that started supporting that feature, they can!
