# copilot-feature-matrix

## TODOS
- [17-AUG-2025] should the rows be features or IDEs? (i.e., should the columns be features or IDEs?)
- show the IDE version you are displaying the features for on the first tab (i.e. static feature matrix). This should be the latest IDE version for all.
- Add BYOK for VS Code? (1.99)
- Should I add in experiemental? https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_98#_github-copilot
- add upgrade agents

    "1.94.0": {
      "Code referencing": { "releaseType": "preview" } //preview?
    },
      "Workspace indexing": { "releaseType": "ga" } //not really a new feature, but in 1.95 we added the ability to manually kick off an index without having to call @workspace


both agent mode and vision for 1.97 say they were only insiders for the 2-6 changelog post. does this mean they are 1.97 or were they brought to stable on 1.98? I think in the 1.98 changelog on the vs code docs it mentions thats when they started rolling out to stable.

 "1.5.0": {
      "Chat": { "releaseType": "ga" }
    },

    there is no longer a 1.5.0 release listed on the official version history. but reading between the lines, this is likely accurate. this is further "confirmed" by ChatGPT
